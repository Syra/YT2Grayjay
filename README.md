Simple Script to convert youtube History to grayjay history


You need python and a takeout of your youtube history.
extract watch.history.json (in this example we use d:\python as our working directory)
adjust path in the script if using a different one.

run it.

download a fresh grayjay export
inject freshly generated history into the file under stores.
reimport it into grayjay - you can skip all imports other than history
